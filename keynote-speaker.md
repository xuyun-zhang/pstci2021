| Networked Systems and Security Research in the Age of AI/Machine Learning |
|**Abstract**|
| Networked systems have created new opportunities with major societal implications. At the same time, security has emerged as one of the most important socio-technical challenges confronting society. AI/machine learning (ML) techniques are expected to enable networked systems and enhance security. In this talk, I will present my recent research on networked systems and security in the age of AI/ML. First, I will introduce my ML-enabled Counter Unmanned Aircraft System(s) (C-UAS) technology that detects and safely neutralizes rogue drones without destroying them or causing them to crash. This research has been featured by 100+ news media outlets. Next I will present my follow-up research on real-time ML for quickest event (threat/intrusion/vulnerability…) detection. Then I will introduce my research on data-efficient ML, particularly distant domain transfer learning. |

| Causal Inference learning for recommender systems |
|**Abstract**|
| Causal learning has attracted a lot of research attention with the advance in explainable artificial intelligence. Causal learning contains causal discovery and causal inference two directions, where causal inference is to estimate the causal effects in treatment guided by causal graph structure and has been extended in tasks of counterfactual analysis, disentanglement learning, and debiasing. In this talk, we will introduce our new proposal of incorporating causal learning into recommender systems, and present two recent research on de-biasing confounding in recommendation and causal disentanglement for Intent Learning in Recommendation. Experimental studies on real world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the proposed models.  |
